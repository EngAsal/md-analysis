1. 5ue6.pdb is downloaded from PDB and cleaned using grep -v HETATM and grep -v CONECT
2. chain A is copied into a seperate PDB file .
3. The topology is generated using pdb2gmx with TIP3P water model and amber14sb ff, resulting in 5ue6_newbox.gro
   topology contains all the information required to define a molecule in a simulation: nonbonded (atom type and charge) and bonded (bpnds, angles, dihedrals, and connectivity)
4. The system is solvated and the ions are added.
5. Energy of the system is minimized.
6. The temperature and pressure of the system is equilibrated.
7. Production run is performed for 20 microseconds 
8. The protein is centered and accounted for periodicity using gmx trjconv, resulting in final_center.xtc
9. The residues in topology (editconf) and trajectory (trjconv) files are renumbered to start from 1, resulting in monomer1.gro and monomer.xtc
